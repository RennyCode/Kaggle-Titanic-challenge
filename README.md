## Kaggle Titanic challenge

The project is an entry for the Titanic challenge in the Kaggle website, in this challenge we are tasked with creating a pridiction model to predict the survival of an individual.
The work has two part, matching my own proggress in the subject, the fist part includes SGD and MLP models and  a

## Workflow
1. Load the data. 
2. Clean and sort data.
3. Create and train .
4. Find best version of our model.
5. Submit the best performing model to the competition.



## Data handling:
- earse feature with high precentage of empty rows
- filling missing values (by median or catigorical)
- removing features with low correlation to our target
- test the grouping features with high correlation 

## Models
- MPL
- SGD
- KNN
